            <h1>Welcome to HydroHarvest</h1>
            <p>In the face of growing environmental challenges, innovative solutions are crucial for sustainable resource management. Our project introduces a cutting-edge technology designed to address two pressing needs simultaneously: water purification and renewable energy generation. This technology leverages the power of water filtration and hydroelectric turbines to create a dual-purpose system that not only cleans rainwater but also harnesses its flow to generate electricity. By integrating these functionalities into a single unit, we aim to enhance the efficiency of water resource management and support the development of self-sustaining energy solutions.

                The system operates by channeling rainwater through a filtration process, which removes impurities and ensures clean water for various uses. Concurrently, the flow of water drives a turbine, generating hydroelectric power that can be utilized to supply electricity to local communities. This dual-function technology aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation,  Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, and Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.  our project not only promotes the reuse of rainwater but also advances renewable energy initiatives, paving the way for more resilient and eco-friendly communities.</p>
